\usage{
jzsbf01(
  t,
  n,
  n1 = n,
  n2 = n,
  r = 1/sqrt(2),
  type = c("two.sample", "one.sample", "paired"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{\eqn{t}-statistic}

\item{n}{Sample size (per group)}

\item{n1}{Sample size in group 1 (only required for two-sample \eqn{t}-test
with unequal group sizes)}

\item{n2}{Sample size in group 2 (only required for two-sample \eqn{t}-test
with unequal group sizes)}

\item{r}{Scale parameter of the Cauchy prior. Defaults to \code{1/sqrt(2)}}

\item{type}{Type of \eqn{t}-test associated with \eqn{t}-statistic. Can be
`"two.sample"`, `"one.sample"`, `"paired"`. Defaults to `"two.sample"}

\item{log}{Logical indicating whether natural logarithm of the Bayes factor
should be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{stats::integrate}}
}
\value{
Bayes factor in favor of the null hypothesis over the alternative (BF
    > 1 indicates evidence for the null hypothesis, whereas BF < 1 indicates
    evidence for the alternative)
}
\description{
This function computes the Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow Bayes factor
    that quantifies the evidence that the data provide for the null
    hypothesis that the standardized mean difference is zero vs. that the
    alternative that it is non-zero.

 The data are summarized by \eqn{t}-statistics and sample sizes. The
    following types of \eqn{t}-tests are accepted:

- Two-sample \eqn{t}-test where the SMD represents the standardized
mean difference between two group means (assuming equal variances in
both groups)
- One-sample \eqn{t}-test where the SMD represents the standardized
mean difference to the null value
- Paired \eqn{t}-test where the SMD represents the standardized mean
difference score

The JZS Bayes factor is implemented as equation (1) in Rouder et al. (2014).
Integration is performed numerically with \code{stats::integrate}

\examples{
## values from Table 1 in Rouder et al. (2019)
jzsbf01(t = 3.20, n = 100, r = 1, type = "one.sample")
jzsbf01(t = 0.69, n = 100, r = 1, type = "one.sample")

## examples from p. 232 in Rouder et al. (2019)
jzsbf01(t = c(2.24, 2.03), n = 80, r = 1, type = "one.sample")
