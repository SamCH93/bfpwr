  k,
  power,
  sd,
  null = 0,

  psd,

\arguments{
\item{k}{Bayes factor threshold}

\item{power}{Target power}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation of one unit}

\item{null}{Parameter value under the point null hypothesis. Defaults to 0}

\item{pm}{Mean of the normal prior assigned to the parameter under the
alternative in the analysis}

\item{psd}{Standard deviation of the normal prior assigned to the parameter
under the alternative in the analysis. Set to 0 to obtain a point prior
at the prior mean}

\item{dpm}{Mean of the normal design prior assigned to the parameter.
Defaults to the same value as specified for the analysis prior \code{pm}}

\item{dpsd}{Standard deviation of the normal design prior assigned to the
parameter. Set to 0 to obtain a point prior at the prior mean. Defaults
to the same value as specified for the analysis prior \code{psd}}

\item{nrange}{Sample size search range over which numerical search is
performed. Defaults to \code{c(1, 10^5)}}

\item{lower.tail}{Logical indicating whether Pr(BF \eqn{\leq} \code{k})
(\code{TRUE}) or Pr(BF \eqn{>} \code{k}) (\code{FALSE}) should be
computed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{integer}{Logical indicating whether only integer valued sample sizes
should be returned. If \code{TRUE} the required sample size is rounded to
the next larger integer. Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{analytical}{Logical indicating whether analytical (if available) or
numerical method should be used. Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{stats::uniroot}}
}
\value{
The required sample size to achieve the specified power
}
\description{
This function computes the required sample size to obtain a
    Bayes factor (\link{bf01}) less or greater than a threshold \code{k} with
    a specified target power.
}
\examples{
## point alternative (analytical and numerical solution available)
nbf01(k = 1/10, power = 0.9, sd = 1, null = 0, pm = 0.5, psd = 0,
      analytical = c(TRUE, FALSE), integer = FALSE)

## standardized mean difference (unit sd = sqrt(2), effective sample size = per group size)
nbf01(k = 1/10, power = 0.9, sd = sqrt(2), null = 0, pm = 0, psd = 1)
## this is the sample size per group (assuming equally sized groups)

## z-transformed correlation (unit sd = 1, effective sample size = n - 3)
nbf01(k = 1/10, power = 0.9, sd = 1, null = 0, pm = 0.2, psd = 0.5)
## have to add 3 to obtain the actual sample size

## log hazard/odds ratio (unit sd = 2, effective sample size = total number of events)
nbf01(k = 1/10, power = 0.9, sd = 2, null = 0, pm = 0, psd = sqrt(0.5))
## have to convert the number of events to a sample size
