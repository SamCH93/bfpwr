\usage{
powernmbf01(
  n = NULL,
  power = NULL,
  k = 1/10,
  sd = 1,
  null = 0,
  psd,
  type = c("two.sample", "one.sample", "paired"),
  dpm,
  dpsd,
  nrange = c(1, 10^5)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size. Has to be \code{NULL} if \code{power} is specified.
Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{power}{Target power. Has to be \code{NULL} if \code{n} is specified.
Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{k}{Bayes factor threshold. Defaults to \code{1/10}, Jeffreys' threshold
for 'strong evidence' against the null hypothesis}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation of one observation (for \code{type =
"two.sample"} or \code{type = "one.sample"}) or of one difference within
a pair of observations (\code{type = "paired"}). Is assumed to be known.
Defaults to \code{1}}

\item{null}{Mean difference under the point null hypothesis. Defaults to
\code{0}}

\item{psd}{Spread of the normal moment prior assigned to the parameter under
the alternative in the analysis. The modes of the prior are located at
\eqn{\pm\sqrt{2}\,\code{psd}}{+-sqrt(2)*\code{psd}}}

\item{type}{The type of test. One of \code{"two.sample"},
\code{"one.sample"}, \code{"paired"}. Defaults to \code{"two.sample"}}

\item{dpm}{Mean of the normal design prior assigned to the parameter}

\item{dpsd}{Standard deviation of the normal design prior assigned to the
parameter. Set to 0 to obtain a point prior at the prior mean}

\item{nrange}{Sample size search range over which numerical search is
performed (only taken into account when \code{n} is \code{NULL}).
Defaults to \code{c(1, 10^5)}}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{"power.bftest"}, a list of the arguments
    (including the computed one) augmented with \code{method} and \code{note}
    elements
}
\description{
Compute probability that Bayes factor under normality is smaller
    than a specified threshold (the power), or determine sample size to
    obtain a target power
}
\note{
An error message will be displayed in case that the specified target
    power is not achievable under the specified analysis and design priors.

## determine power

## determine sample size
