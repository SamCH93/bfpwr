\usage{
powerbinbf01seq(
  n1,
  n2,
  k = 1/10,
  kf = 1/k,
  p0 = 0.5,
  type = c("direction"),

  b = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{Sample size at interim stage}

\item{n2}{Sample size at final stage}

\item{k}{Bayes factor threshold for evidence for efficacy . Defaults to
\code{1/10}, Jeffreys' threshold for 'strong evidence' against the null
hypothesis}

\item{kf}{Bayes factor threshold for evidence for futility. Defaults to
\code{1/k}.}

\item{p0}{Tested binomial proportion. Defaults to \code{0.5}}

\item{type}{Typo of test. Currently only \code{"directional"} is implemented}

\item{a}{Number of successes parameter of the beta analysis prior
distribution. Defaults to \code{1}}

\item{b}{Number of failures parameter of the beta analysis prior
distribution. Defaults to \code{1}}

\item{dp}{Fixed binomial proportion assumed for the power calculation. Set to
\code{NA} to use a truncated beta design prior instead (specified via the
\code{da}, \code{db}, \code{dl}, and \code{du} arguments). Defaults to
\code{NA}}

\item{da}{Number of successes parameter of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
the same value \code{a} as specified for the analysis prior}

\item{db}{Number of failures parameter of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
the same value \code{b} as specified for the analysis prior}

\item{dl}{Lower truncation limit of of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
\code{0}}

\item{du}{Upper truncation limit of of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
\code{1}}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{"power.bftestseq"}, i.e., a list of the
    arguments, computed probabilitites and expected samples sizes, and
    \code{method} and \code{note} elements
}
\description{
Compute design characteristics for two-stage binomial Bayes
    factor design which stops for futility if the binomial Bayes factor
    (\link{binbf01}) is equal or below a threshold at final stage, taking
    into account that the study can stop if it is greater than a specified
    threshold at interim.
}
\details{
For some users, the low-level function \link{pbinbf01seq} that is
    used internally may also be useful.

\examples{
## point prior under the alternative
powerbinbf01seq(n1 = 20, n2 = 40, k = 1/10, kf = 3, p0 = 0.2, dp = 0.4)

## uniform prior [0.2, 1] under the alternative
powerbinbf01seq(n1 = 20, n2 = 40, k = 1/10, kf = 3, p0 = 0.2, dl = 0.2, du = 1)
