\title{Power calculations for binomial Bayes factor with two-stage designs}
\usage{
pbinbf01seq(
  n1,
  n2,
  k = 1/10,
  kf = 1/k,
  p0 = 0.5,
  type = c("direction"),
  a = 1,
  b = 1,
  dp = NA,
  da = a,
  db = b,
  dl = 0,
  du = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{Sample size at interim stage}

\item{n2}{Sample size at final stage}

\item{k}{Bayes factor threshold for evidence for efficacy . Defaults to
\code{1/10}, Jeffreys' threshold for 'strong evidence' against the null
hypothesis}

\item{kf}{Bayes factor threshold for evidence for futility. Defaults to
\code{1/k}.}

\item{p0}{Tested binomial proportion. Defaults to \code{0.5}}

\item{type}{Typo of test. Currently only \code{"directional"} is implemented}

\item{a}{Number of successes parameter of the beta analysis prior
distribution. Defaults to \code{1}}

\item{b}{Number of failures parameter of the beta analysis prior
distribution. Defaults to \code{1}}

\item{dp}{Fixed binomial proportion assumed for the power calculation. Set to
\code{NA} to use a truncated beta design prior instead (specified via the
\code{da}, \code{db}, \code{dl}, and \code{du} arguments). Defaults to
\code{NA}}

\item{da}{Number of successes parameter of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
the same value \code{a} as specified for the analysis prior}

\item{db}{Number of failures parameter of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
the same value \code{b} as specified for the analysis prior}

\item{dl}{Lower truncation limit of of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
\code{0}}

\item{du}{Upper truncation limit of of the truncated beta design prior
distribution. Is only taken into account if \code{dp = NA}. Defaults to
\code{1}}
}
\value{
The probability of obtaining a Bayes factor equal or below k at the
    final stage taking into account potential futility stopping with BF01 >
    kf at interim
}
\description{
Compute probability that binomial Bayes factor (\link{binbf01})
    is equal or below a threshold at final stage, taking into account that
    the study can stop if it is above a threshold at interim.

\examples{
## under truncated beta prior (seems not correct yet when compared to simulation)
pbinbf01seq(n1 = 10, n2 = 20, k = 1/10, kf = 3, p0 = 0.2, a = 1, b = 1, dl = 0.2, du = 1)

## under point prior
pbinbf01seq(n1 = 10, n2 = 20, k = 1/10, kf = 3, p0 = 0.2, a = 1, b = 1, dp = 0.4)
