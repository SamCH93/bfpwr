\usage{
powertbf01(
  k = 1/10,
  n = NULL,
  power = NULL,
  null = 0,
  plocation = 0,
  pscale = 1/sqrt(2),
  pdf = 1,
  type = c("two.sample", "one.sample", "paired"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{Bayes factor threshold. Defaults to \code{1/10}, Jeffreys' threshold
for 'strong evidence' against the null hypothesis}

\item{n}{Sample size (per group for two-sample tests). Has to be \code{NULL}
if \code{power} is specified. Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{power}{Target power. Has to be \code{NULL} if \code{n} is specified.
Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{null}{Standardized mean difference under the point null hypothesis.
Defaults to \code{0}}

\item{plocation}{Analysis \eqn{t} prior location. Defaults to \code{0}}

\item{pscale}{Analysis \eqn{t} prior scale. Defaults to \code{1/sqrt(2)}}

\item{pdf}{Analysis \eqn{t} prior degrees of freedom. Defaults to \code{1} (a
Cauchy prior)}

\item{type}{The type of test. One of \code{"two.sample"},
\code{"one.sample"}, \code{"paired"}. Defaults to \code{"two.sample"}}

\item{alternative}{Direction of the test. Can be either \code{"two.sided"}
(default), \code{"less"} , or \code{"greater"}. The latter two truncate
the analysis prior to negative and positive effects, respectively}

\item{dpm}{Mean of the normal design prior assigned to the standardized mean
difference. Defaults to the analysis prior location}

\item{dpsd}{Standard deviation of the normal design prior assigned to the
standardized mean difference. Set to \code{0} to obtain a point prior at
the design prior mean. Defaults to the analysis prior scale}

\item{nrange}{Sample size search range over which numerical search is
performed (only taken into account when \code{n} is \code{NULL}).
Defaults to \code{c(2, 10^4)}}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{"power.bftest"}, a list of the arguments
    (including the computed one) augmented with \code{method} and \code{note}
    elements
}
\description{
Compute probability that \eqn{t}-test Bayes factor is smaller
    than a specified threshold (the power), or determine sample size to
    obtain a target power
}
\note{
An error message will be displayed in case that the specified target
    power is not achievable under the specified analysis and design priors.

\examples{
## determine power
powertbf01(k = 1/6, n = 146, dpm = 0.5, dps = 0, alternative = "greater")

## determine sample size
plot(powertbf01(k = 1/6, power = 0.95, dpm = 0.5, dps = 0, alternative = "greater"),
     nlim = c(5, 300))


## TODO implement possibility to power for null?
